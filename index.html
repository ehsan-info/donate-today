        <p>People in Sylhet are facing a deadly crisis as the flood water in their area are increasing. Like all
            conflicts, this will quickly turn into a people's crisis, and they will need as much humanitarian support
            and help as we can provide.</p>

                <h4>Food for a family</h4>
                <p>The people who are affected by floods are appealing for government intervention in the looming food
                    shortages. The affected communities lost their crops, whole others lost animals that either drowned
                    or got stolen after the owners abandoned them due to the flooding. Sylhet this year experienced the
                    worst flooding in decades which affected 500 000 people, displaced 60 000, while 19 000 were
                    relocated to relocation camps in the affected regions.</p>

                <h4>Shelter for a family</h4>
                <p>Eight people were killed – five from one family – while thousands more have had their homes washed
                    away or flooded, while communal latrines are unusable and clean water unavailable. Home gardens
                    which allow households to grow their own food have also been destroyed. The rains are ongoing and
                    prolonged, and the level of damage is expected to increase over the coming days. The people affected
                    by fires in March are now severely impacted by flooding.</p>

                <h4>Education for a child</h4>
                <p>Severe weather poses all sorts of challenges for educators and students. It can force schools to shut
                    temporarily and keep kids at home. It can cause infrastructure damage, which has been happening in
                    Sylhet. There, job losses, coastal erosion and floods caused people to move away, leading to
                    diminishing school enrollment and, in some cases, permanent school closures. Those population
                    changes, sometimes called “climate migration,” starve some schools of resources and lead to
                    overcrowding in others.</p>
